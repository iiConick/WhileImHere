        We've all had things we've been meaning to do, but just haven't had time to get around to. <i>While I'm Here</i> allows you to drop the location of where a certain task needs to be completed, and will give you a reminder to complete the task when you’re in the area. For example, you’ve been meaning to go to the dollar store to pick up some cheap essentials, and you’ve just visited Walmart which is in the same plaza. <i>While I'm Here</i> will send you a notification that you are in a close proximity to the dollar store and suggest that you stop there to finish your task. This would save you from making independent trips for non-essential items/tasks, without the hassle of remembering to do them.
